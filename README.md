Mental Aid Hub
Mental Aid Hub is a modern, comprehensive web application designed to provide confidential and accessible mental health support. It offers a suite of tools for self-care and professional assistance, all within a secure and user-friendly platform. The application is built using React and modern web technologies to deliver a fast and responsive experience.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Users can securely sign up and log in via email and password, with state management handled by Supabase. The app uses protected routes to ensure sensitive data is only accessible to authenticated users.

Mental Health Assessments: The app includes standardized self-assessment tools, such as the PHQ-9 (for depression) and GAD-7 (for anxiety), to help users understand their mental state.

Curated Resources: A library of helpful resources is available, including articles, guided audio sessions, videos, and downloadable PDFs, categorized by topic to help users with stress, anxiety, depression, and coping skills.

Counsellor Booking: A feature that allows users to browse a list of professional counsellors and book simulated sessions, showcasing a potential path to professional help.

Anonymous Mode: The welcome screen offers an anonymous mode, providing a barrier-free entry for users who prefer not to create an account.

Multi-language Support: The application is built with internationalization (i18n) support, allowing for an inclusive experience with translations for English, Hindi, Kashmiri, and Dogri.
